# Advent of Code

This repository contains my solutions to [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/), as far as I
have them of course. Language of choice is Java, with [Project Lombok](https://projectlombok.org/)
sprinkled on top. Check out the `pom.xml` for more details, such as minimum Java version. Although
this project uses Maven, I run each solution individually in
[IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/), so running from CLI will require some work.

Issues with ideas or suggestions are welcome, but no spoilers please.
